      <h2>Drop in Number of Properties Sold</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In the mid-2020s, we observed a significant drop in the number of commercial property sales, falling from an average of around 60 to fewer than 10 properties sold.</li>
        <li>During this period, the drop was mainly attributed to reduced sales across all regions, with only the central region continuing to see some activity.</li>
        <li>This decline could be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, where government-imposed measures discouraged potential buyers from purchasing physical stores.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="text-box">
      <h2>Overall Sales by Region</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sales are primarily concentrated in the central region, despite it having a smaller average property size and lower costs compared to other regions.</li>
        <li>This can be attributed to the central location, which hosts a high concentration of businesses and recreational areas. This makes it more accessible and attractive for the working class, resulting in higher foot traffic and more potential customers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Business Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Offices are predominantly located in the central district due to their accessibility to the working class, especially in areas like the CBD. They tend to have an average lifespan of 51-100 years, as reflected by higher average property prices.</li>
        <li>Retail and shop houses are more evenly spread out, as their goal is to be accessible to the entire population .</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Analysis of Remaining Tenure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>From the area plot, we can see that the most popular option across all business types is the Freehold option.</li>
            <li>For retail and shop house businesses, if you're considering a freehold option, the north region offers the lowest cost per unit.</li>
            <li>For office spaces, buyers often prefer locations near the central area due to convenience and accessibility, rather than prioritizing unit price considerations like retail and shop houses.</li>
